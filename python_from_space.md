# Python from Space: Analyzing Open Satellite Imagery Using the Python Ecosystem
Speaker: Katherine Scott (github.com/kscottz/PythonFromSpace)

There are lots of public-data satellites, and you can get data from them.  Can also get some data for non-commercial purposes from some private-sector satellites.

How to get the data?

+ Planet explorer data
+ Open California
+ Planet emergency response
+ Planet Ambassadors
+ Planet ... (didn't catch it)

## Satellite Terminology: Bands

+ more bands = more info
  + see thru clouds
  + identify plants!

+ cadence: how often a satellite images a specific area
+ GSD: how many meters/pixel of data
+ number of bands

+ remote sensing
+ ortho-rectification
+ nadir angle (off-meter satellite imagery)
+ Raster/vector
+ UTM
+ UDM
+ DEM

`shapely` <-- a geometry library.  May be useful for my own purposes...

Walks through a Jupyter notebook creating the satellite imagery data gif of the area surrounding this conference!

`resterio` <-- another image processing library. Potentially also useful for my purposes!!!

Walks through an example incorporating data from OpenStreetMaps.

Geopy has an ability to do 'reverse geo-lookup' calculations.
